COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER
No sprites herein is changed. All sprites here belong to respective modders. 
Except the ones are added to fill up the oh no and the techs to make the mod campaign playable or to compensate for some bugs. 
eg. nickel drills, super alloy walls. 

BALANCING DISCLAIMER
No content taken from the original mod are changed unless there are bugs and ducplicates. 
Thus some tech may be very OP (example: Tantria's Devestator) or useless (example: all hyperspace turrets)  
Things are added to make the mod playable. They may also be OP. 

Java mods that are not working will be converted to json-javaScript format.

current affairs: 
- intm_main tech tree aims on other mods that have no errors but unplayable in the campaign mode or prevents further explorations.
