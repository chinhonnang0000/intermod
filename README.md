COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER
No sprites herein is changed UNLESS prompted by original modder via issues. All sprites here belong to respective modders. 
Except the ones are added to fill up the "oh no" and the techs to make the mod campaign playable or to compensate for some bugs. 
eg. nickel drills, super alloy walls. astroidgen shall receive the same treatment by other modders if not working properly for 1 or more weeks. 

#BALANCING DISCLAIMER
No content taken from the original mod are changed unless there are bugs and ducplicates. 

Different difficulty perspective by different modders 
Thus some tech may be very OP (example: Tantria's Devestator) or useless (example: all hyperspace turrets)  
Java mods that are not working will be converted to json-javaScript format.

Addition and supplemntary
a lot of things could be added once the original mod works and resolves its errors.  
For example if Tantria "works" again, minimum 3 tiers and 10 missions will be added. Each will be more overpowered than the last.   
- Things are added to make the mod playable (intm_main). They will be OP in higher tiers.
