Different difficulty perspective by different modders 
Thus some tech may be very OP (example: Tantria's Devestator) or useless (example: all hyperspace turrets)  
Java mods that are not working will be converted to json-javaScript format.

Addition and supplemntary
a lot of things could be added once the original mod works and resolves its errors.  
For example if Tantria "works" again, minimum 3 tiers and 10 missions will be added. Each will be more overpowered than the last.   
- Things are added to make the mod playable (intm_main). They will be OP in higher tiers.
